Essence of Python
Version 0.0001 (unfinished)

A beautiful scripting language dreamt up in a stupor by @zirconcode and @alucard17
Official Language of Tautology Club

requires: ruby, brainfuck

table:
a = tab, b = whitespace
brainfuck = ><+-.,[] with .b extension

TODO: 
- essence of python should not be backwards compatible
- newline? 
- make it better, too boring

Enjoy!
